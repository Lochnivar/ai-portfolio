# AI Portfolio

A reference repository showcasing AI applications across **creative**, **analytical**, and **professional** contexts.

## Overview

This repository serves as a documentation and reference hub for 5 AI projects, demonstrating practical applications of artificial intelligence in different domains:

- **Creative**: Artistic and expressive AI applications (image generation, creative writing, music, etc.)
- **Analytical**: Data-driven AI solutions (predictive modeling, machine learning, business intelligence, etc.)
- **Professional**: Enterprise and productivity-focused AI tools (automation, workflow optimization, etc.)

> **Note**: This repository contains project summaries and links to the actual project repositories. The included HTML/CSS/JS files can be deployed to any static hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, etc.) but this repo itself serves as a reference point.
